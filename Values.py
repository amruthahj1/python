value is one of the fundamental things — like a word or a number — that a program manipulates. T
he values we have seen so far are 5 (the result when we added 2 + 3), and "Hello, World!". 
We often refer to these values as objects and we will use the words value and object interchangeably.
These objects are classified into different classes, or data types: 4 is an integer, and "Hello, World!" is a string, 
so-called because it contains a string or sequence of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
Objects are also called data structures. Python comes with some built-in objects. Some are used so often that Python has a quick way to make these objects, called literals. Th
e literals include the string, unicode string, integer, float, long, list, tuple and dictionary types.

Python Statement. Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements.
For example, a = 1 is an assignment statement. if statement, for statement, while statement etc.
